# Terraform Nonstandard Library

This library is our version of a standard library for C++. It includes polyfills
to bring future features back to older language versions, a suite of macros to
ease metaprogramming in the patterns we typically use, and a slew of typedefs
which give us short unambiguous names for primitives.

It also includes some STL-like features that are either not present in the STL,
are implemented too generically for our purposes, or did not exist at the time
we added the features to the nonstandard library.

Depending on the eponymous `nonstd` target will put the whole library in scope
for you, and `#include "nonstd.h"` will bring the whole shebang in to the file
you're working in. This should be present in *all* terraform code.

If you're feeling ambitious and want to hack some build time off our binaries,
see if you can figure out how to turn that target into a precompiled header.
