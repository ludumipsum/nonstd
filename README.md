The repository exists purely for demonstration and sentimental purposes. It was
extracted from a much larger C++ repository, most of which isn't as suitable for
sharing as this foundational library code.

This code will _absolutely not_ build. That is in part due to not including
vendored thirdparty code that this library relies on, and some is because this
code is built using [Postmodern_CMake], which is similarly not included here.

It's my hope that there is still some code worth reading in here, though.
